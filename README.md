# Word Frequency Histogram

This project is a React.js application that fetches a text file, analyzes the word frequency, and displays it as a bar chart. It also provides an option to export the word frequency data as a CSV file.

## Components

The code consists of the following components:

### App

The `App` component is the main component of the application. It handles the state for the text data and word frequency histogram. It fetches the text file from the API, calculates the word frequency, and updates the histogram state. It also provides two buttons: "Submit" to fetch and analyze the text data, and "Export" to export the word frequency data as a CSV file.

### Dependencies

The following libraries and plugins were used for this React.js project:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **recharts**: A charting library for React.js that provides a simple and declarative way to create bar charts.
